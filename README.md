# CZtack

Cztack (pronounced "stack") is CZI's collection of Terraform modules. We use these as way to scale our infrastructure work.

These modules are compatible with Terraform 0.12 and up.

## Design Principles

More TODO here

### Consistent Tagging

We tag all applicable resources with 'owner', 'project', 'env', 'service' and 'managedBy'.

## Modules

### AWS Default VPC security

This will name, tag, and optionall lock down AWS default VPCs.

[Read More](aws-default-vpc-security/README.md)

### AWS IAM ECS Task Role

This creates a role for use with an ECS task, you bring your own policy and we create the role for you.

[Read More](aws-iam-ecs-task-role/README.md)

### AWS IAM Group assume-role

This module with create and IAM group, add users to it and grant the grouop permission to assume a role. This is commonly used for cross-account access control.

[Read More](aws-iam-group-assume-role/README.md)

### AWS IAM Group console-login

This will create a group, add users to it, and grant permission to log into the AWS console and manage one's own credentials.

[Read More](aws-iam-group-console-login/README.md)

### AWS IAM password policy

This module will create a good password policy for your AWS account.

[Read More](aws-iam-password-policy/README.md)

### AWS IAM instance profile

This module will create an EC2 instance profile, attaching to it a new IAM role with permissions to run standard system agents (Systems Manager Agent and Cloudwatch Logs Agent).

[Read More](aws-iam-instance-profile/README.md)

### AWS IAM cloudwatch logs policy

This will create a policy that allow writing to cloudwatch logs.

[Read More](aws-iam-policy-cwlogs/README.md)

### AWS IAM poweruser role

This will create a poweruser role, based off the AWS-managed "poweruser" policy, but with a few additions that we find useful.

[Read More](aws-iam-poweruser/README.md)

### AWS IAM Role Cloudfront poweruser

This will create a role that gives "poweruser" level access to cloudfront.

[Read More](aws-iam-role-cloudfront-poweruser/README.md)

### AWS IAM Role ECS poweruser

This will create a role that gives "poweruser" level access to ECS.

[Read More](aws-iam-role-ecs-poweruser/README.md)

### AWS IAM Role infraci

This is a role we find useful for running CI jobs for terraform code. It is based on the AWS-managed policy for readonly, but includes a few additions, like the ability to read secrets.

[Read More](aws-iam-role-infraci/README.md)

### AWS IAM role readonly

This creates a readonly role, based off the AWS-managed readonly policy, but with a few changes.

[Read More](aws-iam-role-readonly/README.md)

### AWS IAM role security-audit

This creates a security-audit role, based off the AWS-managed policy, but with a few changes.

### Writing tests

A few notes on writing test for this repo. Note that this is new ground for us, so this will be a work in progress.

* To make modules testable, all fields that have a unique constraint need to be parameterizeable. Otherwise concurrent tests will conflict.
* It is tempting in testing module A to use module B to set up some context, but because terragrunt will just store the statefile locally, you can have a conflict.
  * We've tried to avoid this for now and set up context more directly
  * And also to not run tests in parrallel
  * and to clean up state files before and after each run
* our linter requires a test for each module. At the very least run `init` so that its syntax is checked. See [an example here](aws-iam-group-assume-role/module_test.go).
* AWS IAM is eventually consistent and supposedly is homed in us-east-1, so its probably best to run all tests that use IAM in that region.

#### Test Dependencies
* [go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)
* [terraform-provider-bless](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/terraform-provider-bless/releases) - Place it in the same directory as your terraform executable. `dirname \`which terraform\``
