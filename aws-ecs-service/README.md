# ECS Service

This module creates an ECS service fronted by a public ALB.

## Terraform managed task definition vs czecs

If the user sets `var.manage_task_definition = true`, Terraform will manage the lifecycle
of the container definition; any external changes are reset on the next Terraform run.

If var.manage_task_definition = false, the user is expected to manage the
container definition external to Terraform (e.g. using [czecs](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/czecs)). Upon creation,
Terraform will use a stub definition, but from that point forward will ignore any
changes to the definition, allowing external task definition management.

## Example

```hcl
data "aws_route53_zone" "zone" {
  name         = "example.com."
  private_zone = false
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role" {

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "role" {
  name               = "${var.project}-${var.env}-myservice"
  description        = "Task role for myservice in ${var.env} environment"

## Service Discovery

In addition to a load balancer, this module supports registering all instances of
tasks with DNS via ECS service discovery. If with_service_discovery is true, a new private
DNS zone is created, and the tasks are registered in that DNS zone. The domain name is only
resolvable from within the VPC; it is not publicly resolvable.
